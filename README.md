# Project Overview
This project is based on Grant Collins's ["Malware Analysis Project"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDjng0_4bmMvtDw94WcyzpegCOMCs3MP). The goal of this project is to statically and dynamically analyze various malwares via virtual machines. The target system will be a virtual machine running the Windows 10 Enterprise operating sytsem with the FLARE-VM software suite installed to provide malware analysis capabilities. We will also be using REMnux in a virtual machine as a C2 server. Below will be documentation regarding the setup for this lab.

# Network Setup

To ensure that relevant systems can only communicate with each other and not the internet, a new network adapter is created in Virtualbox. The adapter is set to the home IP address, 10.0.0.1, as seen below.

The server is then configured to be set to 10.0.0.2, with the range of addresses set between 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.254, as seen below.
