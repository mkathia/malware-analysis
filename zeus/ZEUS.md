# Project Overview
WIP

# Downloading the Malware
To obtain the malicious sample, we must temporarily provide our target system with internet access. To do so, we change it from the previous host-only adapter to a bridged adapter, as seen below.

Then, we can download our malware from the Github page, as seen below.

After doing this, we immediately revert our changes to the internet to once again isolate the machines in their own network. Just to ensure connectivity, we re-ping the machines, as we did in the [README.md](https://github.com/mkathia/malware-analysis/edit/main/README.md) file. Once seeing that the connection is there, we know everything is well, and we can proceed with our malware analysis.

# Extracting the Malware
With our malicious sample on the computer, we open the archive and view the file. Note the double extension, this is used to take advantage of indiviudals who do not have their computers configured to view full file extensions. We extract this file from the archive and place it on our desktop.
